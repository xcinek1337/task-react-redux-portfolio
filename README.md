ProfitCurrency.io is a web application designed to calculate profits or losses on currency investments. The application features an integrated API that automatically fetches currency prices based on the purchase date and selected currency. It utilizes Redux for state management, enabling efficient access to state across nested components. Additionally, the application includes a table summarizing investment details for easy reference.
